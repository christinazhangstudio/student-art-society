# Student Art Society at UTSA Official Website
- - - -
## About
The Student Art Society is a COLFA student organization at the University of Texas at San Antonio. This git repository contains the source code for the website; this is a Python web app, using the Flask framework, deployed on Heroku (for free). The custom domain is:  http://sas-utsa.me. It's short and simple! The default, heroku-provided URL is: https://student-art-society.herokuapp.com/. This URL will remain up even if a custom domain is set up, so it's recommended that for any permanent links, use this one instead of the custom domain (which is prone to expire).

## Maintenance Notes

Everytime files are edited, do the following commands to update this git repo:
```
git add .
```
```
git commit -m "Add your custom commit message here"
```
```
git push
```

The heroku branch needs to be updated as well so that the heroku files are built:
```
git push heroku master
```
You can check the dyno hours/usage and make sure `web` is up with:
```
heroku ps
```

Lastly, open in browser!
```
heroku open
```

The Heroku account associated with the SAS website is Christina Zhang's (Founder/President 2020-2022). If future maintainers would like to shift ownership and create a new Heroku account (recommended), please download this source code or do a `git clone`, create a new Heroku account and login into it through `heroku login`, `cd` to the root directory for this app, create a heroku app through `heroku create`, and lastly do `git push heroku master` and `heroku open`.
